# Spatial-level Transforms and Targets

Spatial-level transforms (also known as dual transforms) simultaneously change both the input image and additional
targets such as masks, bounding boxes, and keypoints.

These transforms are essential for tasks like object detection, segmentation, and keypoint detection, where you
need to ensure that the labels (masks, bounding boxes, keypoints) remain aligned with the transformed image.

For example, if you rotate an image, you also need to rotate the bounding boxes and keypoints to maintain their
correct positions relative to the objects in the image.

## Supported Targets

Here is a table with spatial-level transforms and the targets they support. If you try to apply a spatial-level
transform to an unsupported target, Albumentations will raise an error.
