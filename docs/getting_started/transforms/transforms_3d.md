# 3D Transforms and Targets

3D transforms are designed to work with 3D data such as medical images (e.g., CT scans, MRI). These transforms
can operate on volumetric data and their corresponding 3D masks.

These transforms are particularly useful for medical image analysis, where data is often three-dimensional and
requires specialized augmentation techniques.

## Supported Targets

Here is a table with 3D transforms and the targets they support. If you try to apply a 3D transform to an
unsupported target, Albumentations will raise an error.
