# Optimizing Augmentation Pipelines for Speed

Slow augmentation pipelines can leave your expensive GPUs waiting for data, becoming a significant bottleneck in your training loop. This guide covers key strategies to maximize the throughput of your Albumentations pipelines.

*(For advice on selecting augmentations that improve model generalization, see the [Choosing Augmentations](./choosing-augmentations.md) guide.)*

## Quick Reference: Performance Essentials

**Critical Performance Rules (in order of impact):**

1. **🔥 Crop Early** - [`RandomCrop`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/RandomCrop)/[`RandomResizedCrop`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/RandomResizedCrop) **first** in pipeline (16x speedup possible!)
2. **🔥 Fix OpenCV Threading** - Add `cv2.setNumThreads(0)` in PyTorch DataLoader workers
3. **💾 Use `uint8` Images** - Keep images as `uint8` until final [`Normalize`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/Normalize)
4. **🔧 Combine Transforms** - Use [`Affine`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/Affine) instead of separate rotate+scale
5. **📁 Optimize Image Reading** - Use **OpenCV** (`cv2.imread`) or **torchvision** (`torchvision.io.decode_image`) instead of PIL/Pillow

**Performance Comparison Example:**
```python
# ❌ SLOW: Large image processing
slow = A.Compose([
    A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),           # 1024x1024 → 1M pixels
    A.RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.2), # 1024x1024 → 1M pixels
    A.RandomCrop(224, 224, p=1.0),     # Finally crop
])

# ✅ FAST: Crop first
fast = A.Compose([
    A.RandomCrop(224, 224, p=1.0),     # 224x224 → 50K pixels
    A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),           # 224x224 → 50K pixels
    A.RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.2), # 224x224 → 50K pixels
])
# Result: ~16x fewer pixels processed by most transforms!
```

**Common Performance Killers:**
- Large images processed through entire pipeline
- Multiple DataLoader workers fighting for OpenCV threads
- Expensive transforms applied to full-resolution images
- **PIL/Pillow-based image loading** instead of OpenCV/torchvision

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. Prefer `uint8` Images

Albumentations supports both `uint8` (0-255) and `float32` ( 0.0-1.0) image formats. While `float32` might seem necessary for normalized inputs later, many underlying OpenCV functions used by Albumentations are optimized for `uint8`.

*   **Important Note on `float32`:** If you provide `float32` images, Albumentations expects them to be in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`. Values outside this range will be clipped. Ensure your float images are scaled appropriately *before* passing them to the pipeline if they are not already in the `[0.0, 1.0]` range.
*   **Recommendation:** Perform as much of your augmentation pipeline as possible using `uint8` images. Operations are often faster or at least the same speed compared to `float32`. You can apply [`A.Normalize`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/Normalize) directly to `uint8` images; it handles the conversion to float and scaling correctly based on the `max_pixel_value` (which defaults to 255 for `uint8`).

### 2. Crop Early, Crop First

Applying augmentations to smaller images is significantly faster. If your workflow involves cropping the image (e.g., to a fixed input size for your model), do it as early as possible in the pipeline.

*   **Example:** Cropping an image from 1024x1024 down to 256x256 reduces the number of pixels by a factor of \( (1024 \times 1024) / (256 \times 256) = 16 \). Subsequent augmentations in the pipeline only need to process 1/16th of the original data, leading to significant speedups.
*   **Recommendation:** Place transforms like [`CenterCrop`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/CenterCrop), [`RandomCrop`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/RandomCrop), or especially [`RandomResizedCrop`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/RandomResizedCrop) at the **beginning** of your `Compose` block. This drastically reduces the number of pixels processed by subsequent augmentations.

```python
import albumentations as A

# Good: Crop first
fast_pipeline = A.Compose([
    A.RandomResizedCrop(height=224, width=224, scale=(0.8, 1.0), p=1.0),
    A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    A.RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.2),
    # ... other transforms on 224x224 image ...
    A.Normalize(mean=(0.485, 0.456, 0.406), std=(0.229, 0.224, 0.225)),
])

# Bad: Crop last (much slower)
slow_pipeline = A.Compose([
    A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5), # Applied to large image
    A.RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.2), # Applied to large image
    # ... other transforms on large image ...
    A.RandomResizedCrop(height=224, width=224, scale=(0.8, 1.0), p=1.0),
    A.Normalize(mean=(0.485, 0.456, 0.406), std=(0.229, 0.224, 0.225)),
])
```

### 3. Combine Transforms Where Possible

Fewer transforms generally mean less overhead. Look for opportunities to use transforms that combine multiple operations.

*   **Example 1:** Instead of padding and then cropping, use the built-in padding in cropping transforms. All of [`Crop`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/Crop), [`CenterCrop`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/CenterCrop), and [`RandomCrop`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/RandomCrop) support the `pad_if_needed=True` argument:
    *   [`A.PadIfNeeded(...)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/PadIfNeeded) + [`A.Crop(...)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/Crop) -> [`A.Crop(..., pad_if_needed=True)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/Crop)
    *   [`A.PadIfNeeded(...)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/PadIfNeeded) + [`A.CenterCrop(...)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/CenterCrop) -> [`A.CenterCrop(..., pad_if_needed=True)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/CenterCrop)
    *   [`A.PadIfNeeded(...)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/PadIfNeeded) + [`A.RandomCrop(...)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/RandomCrop) -> [`A.RandomCrop(..., pad_if_needed=True)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/RandomCrop)
*   **Example 2:** Instead of separate flips, use [`SquareSymmetry`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/SquareSymmetry) which combines horizontal and vertical flips (including diagonal options):
    *   [`A.HorizontalFlip(p=...)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/HorizontalFlip) + [`A.VerticalFlip(p=...)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/VerticalFlip) -> [`A.SquareSymmetry(p=...)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/SquareSymmetry) (Note: `SquareSymmetry` applies one of the 4 symmetries: identity, horizontal, vertical, or diagonal flip, based on its internal logic. It's not a direct 1:1 replacement for applying both flips independently but covers similar transformations).
*   **Example 3:** Instead of separate rotation and scaling, use [`Affine`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/Affine), which handles rotation, scaling, translation, and shear in one operation:
    *   [`A.Rotate(...)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/Rotate) + [`A.RandomScale(...)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/RandomScale) -> [`A.Affine(rotate=..., scale=..., p=...)`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/Affine)

Check the documentation for transforms like [`Affine`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/Affine), and [`RandomResizedCrop`](https://explore.albumentations.ai/transform/RandomResizedCrop) as they often combine multiple geometric actions efficiently.

### 4. Optimize Image Reading

While not strictly an Albumentations optimization, the way you read image files from disk significantly impacts overall pipeline speed. Different image loading libraries have dramatically different performance characteristics.

#### Performance Benchmark Results

Recent comprehensive benchmarks comparing image loading libraries show significant performance differences. The chart below shows performance comparison on Apple Silicon (M4 Max):

![Image Loading Performance Comparison](https://github.com/ternaus/imread_benchmark/blob/main/images/performance_darwin.png?raw=true)

*Source: [imread_benchmark repository](https://github.com/ternaus/imread_benchmark) - "Need for Speed: A Comprehensive Benchmark of JPEG Decoders in Python" by Vladimir Iglovikov*

#### Recommended Libraries (Fast)

**Top performers using libjpeg-turbo:**
- **OpenCV (`cv2.imread`)** - Excellent cross-platform performance, widely available
- **torchvision (`torchvision.io.decode_image`)** - Fast and integrates well with PyTorch workflows
- **kornia-rs** - Modern Rust-based implementation with consistent performance

#### Avoid for Performance-Critical Applications

**Slower libraries using standard libjpeg:**
- **PIL/Pillow** - Significantly slower than alternatives
- **scikit-image** - Slower decoding performance
- **imageio** - Generally slower for JPEG decoding

#### Implementation Example

```python
import cv2
import torch
from torchvision.io import decode_image

# Fast option 1: OpenCV (returns BGR, need to convert to RGB)
def load_image_opencv(path):
    image = cv2.imread(path)
    if image is not None:
        image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    return image

# Fast option 2: torchvision (returns tensor, convert to numpy if needed)
def load_image_torchvision(path):
    with open(path, 'rb') as f:
        image_bytes = f.read()
    image = decode_image(torch.frombuffer(image_bytes, dtype=torch.uint8))  # Returns tensor in RGB
    return image.permute(1, 2, 0).numpy()  # Convert to numpy if needed

# Slower option (avoid in performance-critical code)
def load_image_pil(path):
    from PIL import Image
    import numpy as np
    image = Image.open(path).convert('RGB')
    return np.array(image)
```

**Performance Impact:** Switching from PIL to OpenCV or torchvision can provide **2-3x speedup** in image loading, especially noticeable when processing large datasets or using multiple DataLoader workers.

**Recommendation:** Use OpenCV (`cv2.imread`) or torchvision (`torchvision.io.decode_image`) for optimal performance. The [imread_benchmark repository](https://github.com/ternaus/imread_benchmark) provides detailed benchmarks across different platforms and libraries.

### 7. Address Multiprocessing Bottlenecks (OpenCV & PyTorch)

When using Albumentations within a PyTorch `DataLoader` with multiple workers (`num_workers > 0`), you might encounter unexpected slowdowns. This often happens because OpenCV (`cv2`), the backend for many Albumentations transforms, can try to parallelize its own operations using multiple threads.

When each of your DataLoader workers spawns *multiple* OpenCV threads, they can contend for CPU resources, leading to overall slower performance than expected.

*   **Solution:** Force OpenCV to run in single-threaded mode within each worker process. Add this code **at the beginning of your training script** or within the worker initialization:

    ```python
    import cv2
    cv2.setNumThreads(0)
    # Optionally, disable OpenCL if not needed or causing issues
    # cv2.ocl.setUseOpenCL(False)
    ```

    Setting `cv2.setNumThreads(0)` prevents OpenCV from creating its own thread pool within each worker, allowing PyTorch's multiprocessing to manage parallelism effectively.

    *Further Reading: This issue and solution are also highlighted in the [Lightly AI Blog Post](https://www.lightly.ai/post/we-switched-from-pillow-to-albumentations-and-got-2x-speedup).*

### 6. Batch Processing Considerations

Albumentations excels at **per-image processing** and consistently outperforms other augmentation libraries for individual image transformations, as demonstrated in the [Image Benchmarks](https://albumentations.ai/docs/benchmarks/image-benchmarks/).

However, for **large batch training scenarios** (e.g., 1280 images per batch when training ResNet-18 on RTX 4090), there's an important performance consideration for normalization:

#### When to Use GPU Batch Normalization

For **large batches** with **standard normalization only**, consider moving normalization to GPU and applying it to the entire batch at once using torchvision:

```python
# Albumentations pipeline (CPU) - exclude normalization
cpu_pipeline = A.Compose([
    A.RandomResizedCrop(height=224, width=224, scale=(0.8, 1.0), p=1.0),
    A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    A.RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.2),
    # Note: No A.Normalize here
])

# In your training loop (GPU batch normalization)
import torchvision.transforms as T

normalize = T.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])

# Apply augmentations per-image on CPU
batch_images = []
for image in cpu_images:
    augmented = cpu_pipeline(image=image)['image']
    batch_images.append(torch.from_numpy(augmented).permute(2, 0, 1))

# Stack to batch and normalize on GPU
batch_tensor = torch.stack(batch_images).float() / 255.0  # Convert to [0,1]
batch_tensor = batch_tensor.to(device)
normalized_batch = normalize(batch_tensor)  # GPU batch normalization
```

#### Performance Trade-offs

**Use Albumentations normalization when:**
- Small to medium batch sizes
- Complex augmentation pipelines with multiple transforms
- Need consistent per-image processing workflow

**Use GPU batch normalization when:**
- Very large batch sizes (>512 images)
- Simple pipelines with mostly geometric transforms + normalization
- Have sufficient GPU memory for batch processing

The [Video Benchmarks](https://albumentations.ai/docs/benchmarks/video-benchmarks/) demonstrate these batch processing performance characteristics across different scenarios.
