# Advanced Guides

This section covers more advanced features and customization options within Albumentations.

*   **[Using Additional Targets](./additional-targets.md)**
    Learn how to apply the same augmentation parameters synchronously to multiple distinct image or mask inputs (e.g., for stereo images, multi-modal data, or multiple segmentation masks).

*   **[Serialization of Augmentation Pipelines](./serialization.md)**
    Discover how to save your defined augmentation pipelines to JSON or YAML files for reproducibility, sharing, or deployment, and understand the limitations.

*   **[Creating Custom Albumentations Transforms](./creating-custom-transforms.md)**
    Dive into extending Albumentations by creating your own custom transforms, inheriting from base classes, handling different data targets, managing randomness, and validating inputs.

## Where to Go Next?

After identifying the advanced topic you need:

-   **Dive into a specific guide:** Read the detailed explanation for additional targets, serialization, or custom transforms.
-   **Apply Advanced Techniques:** Integrate these features into your specific task pipelines (referencing [Basic Usage Guides](../3-basic-usage/index.md)).
-   **Consult the [API Reference](https://albumentations.ai/docs/api-reference):** Get detailed information on all classes and functions.
-   **Revisit [Core Concepts](../2-core-concepts/index.md):** Ensure you have a solid understanding of the fundamentals before tackling advanced features.
-   **[Visually Explore Transforms](https://explore.albumentations.ai):** Experiment with standard transforms before creating custom ones.
